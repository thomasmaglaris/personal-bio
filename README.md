# personal-bio assignment

This assignment aimed to to create a few linked webpages illustrating a personal webpage which included an index.html (the about me page), a contact.html which showed contact details and a portfolio.html which showed multiple projects I have created. 

This page used bootstrap to make the page mobile responsive along with some minor @media screen alterations present in the CSS

Furthermore, Bootstrap's grid system was incorporated to assist with an adequate lay out of the pages using the grid system. 

All links are working appropriately except for images in the portfolio as there are no completed projects to show as yes. 

The navbar remains consistent for each page and in an attempt to complete the bonus task, a sticky footer was also introduced. 

All .html documents are formatted appopriately and the attempt to use the correct semantics has been utilized. As the correct semantics have been used, adding comments in the html documentation was arguably not needed however refer to comments in the CSS document which gives an explanation on both the changes being made in terms of styling along with what component of a particular webpage is being styled.
